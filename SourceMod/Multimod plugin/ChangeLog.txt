* Version 1.6a
- Functions are now split. Each plugin takes care of its own functionallity and can run indepently (but without the base multimod plugin ofc)
	So now, voting.smx, multimod.smx are split to four plugins:
		. multimod.smx			(Base. none of the others can run without it. This connot run indepently atm. The next update will allow it to).
		. multimod_vote.smx		(Handles voting)
		. multimod_menu.smx		(Handles the multimod menu)
		. multimod_nextcurrentmod.smx	(Handles currentmod and nextmod chat commands)
- IMPORTANT: Added command sm_startvote to the voting plugin. Type sm_startvote "help" in console for more info.
- IMPORTANT: Added a new block method, Block & Save. Choosing this will keep the blocking on the MOD even after map change.
- IMPORTANT: You can now edit MM_DEFAULT_FORCE_CHANGE in multimod_const.inc (Requires recompiling multimod_vote plugin)
		This detemines whether the voting plugin will change mod immidiately after the vote is done, or it should wait for the map end.
- Includes are now split to four:
		. multimod.inc			(Contains base natives like choosing next MOD, getting MOD prop, etc)
		. multimod_vote.inc		(Contains voting natives)
		. multimod_const.inc		(Contains constants that most\all plugins use, any change might require recompiling ALL plugins)
		. multimod_stocks.inc		(Contains stocks used in all plugins. It is only MM_PrintToChat for now :P)
- Added natives:
	# Base Plugin:
		. MultiMod_GetModLock, MultiMod_SetModLock, MultiMod_GetLockedModsCount
		. MultiMod_SetNextMod
		. MultiMod_IsLoaded
	# Voting Plugin:
		. MultiMod_StartVote
- Added forwards:
	# Base Plugin:
		. MultiMod_NextModChanged
